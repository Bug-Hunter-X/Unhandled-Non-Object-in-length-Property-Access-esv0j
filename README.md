# Unhandled Non-Object in length Property Access

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: attempting to access the `length` property of a value that is not an object with a length property.  The code in `bug.js` includes a conditional check for `null` but fails to account for other cases like `undefined` or non-objects, leading to a runtime error.

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) provides a more robust approach using `typeof` to check the type of the input and handling various scenarios appropriately.
